# The Encrypticator Project
Encrypticator stands for Encrypted Communicator and is my High School Senior Capstone Project.

I plan on developing this application throughout the year of 2021-2022 and ending with a demo ready test for my final presentation.

Encrypticator is a secured messaging platform that encrypts users' messages with a zero-knowledge server implementation and encrypts meta-data during transit. Encrypticator’s primary goal is to protect the user’s privacy by only allowing the intended recipients of a message to read the message that was sent. Encrypticator is designed to make it impossible for any company using Encrypticator’s server and client framework to access users’ messages 

## Initial Proposal
Most people in the world, do not care whether their “private” messages are being looked at and analyzed by the corporations that own the messaging platform. Many of the messaging applications out in the world are designed for convenience of the users and not necessarily privacy; many messaging applications that do focus on privacy have the drawbacks of less convenience for more privacy. My project is an encrypted messaging platform that utilizes AES-512-bit encryption on the client side to encrypt data before it is sent to the server to be stored, giving the end-user a more considerable amount of privacy. I will need to conduct extensive research on encryption algorithms and how to securely communicate symmetric encryption keys between clients. I will be using Java and MariaDB (MySQL) as the back end for my messaging platform and Java for the front-end messaging application. At the end of the project, I want a completed messaging app that encrypts messages and hopefully diminish any attack vectors that could cause data leakage to give users the privacy they don’t have today.

## Project Objectives
1. Stay motivated to complete my year-long project.
2. Create a working product that can be used in my everyday life.
3. Gain a stronger understanding of programming and programming structures.
4. Learn about technologies I haven’t touched before, such as ED25519 assymetric encryption.
5. Gain connections in the Computer Science industry.
