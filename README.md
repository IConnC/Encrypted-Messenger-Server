# The Encrypticator Project
Encrypticator stands for Encrypted Communicator and is my High School Senior Capstone Project.

I plan on developing this application throughout the year of 2021-2022 and ending with a demo ready test for my final presentation.


Encrypticator is a secured messaging platform that encrypts users messages on both the server and during transit. Encrypticator’s primary goal is to grant users more privacy in their lives from government agencies, corporations, and cybercriminals. While it is entirely possible that I will not complete the project with it's large scope, I plan on completing as much of it as possible. This project will most likely be a learning opportunity for myself and a challenge for myself to work on a larger-scale project.


## Initial Proposal
Every day, massive corporations and cyber-criminals violate people’s online privacy with very little stopping them. Since they have the power, most people have given up or not even cared about their personal information stolen by giant corporations. My project is an encrypted messaging platform that utilizes SHA-512-bit encryption to encrypt data at rest and in transit, giving the end-user a more considerable amount of privacy. I will need to conduct extensive research on encryption algorithms and, specifically, how to encrypt data at rest since that will be the most challenging part. I will be using Java and MariaDB (MySQL) as the back-end for my messaging platform and Java for the front-end messaging application since Java will execute code on any system. At the end of the project, I want a completed messaging app that encrypts messages on all attack vectors to give users the privacy they don’t have today.

## Project Objectives
1. Stay motivated to complete my year-long project.
2. Create a working product that can be used in my everyday life.
3. Gain a stronger understanding of programming and programming structures.
4. Learn about technologies I haven’t touched before, such as ED25519 assymetric encryption.
5. Gain connections in the Computer Science industry.
