# Senior Capstone Project
Encrypticator - Encrypted Communicator

Encrypticator is a secured messaging platform that encrypts users’ messages on both the server and during transit. Encrypticator’s primary goal is to grant users more privacy in their lives from government agencies, corporations, and cybercriminals.


## Initial Proposal
Every day, massive corporations and cyber-criminals violate people’s online privacy with very little stopping them. Since they have the power, most people have given up or not even cared about their personal information stolen by giant corporations. My project is an encrypted messaging platform that utilizes SHA-512-bit encryption to encrypt data at rest and in transit, giving the end-user a more considerable amount of privacy. I will need to conduct extensive research on encryption algorithms and, specifically, how to encrypt data at rest since that will be the most challenging part. I will be using Java and MariaDB (MySQL) as the back-end for my messaging platform and Java for the front-end messaging application since Java will execute code on any system. At the end of the project, I want a completed messaging app that encrypts messages on all attack vectors to give users the privacy they don’t have today.

## Project Objectives
1. Stay motivated to complete my year-long project.
2. Create a working product that can be used in my everyday life.
3. Gain a stronger understanding of programming and programming structures.
4. Learn about technologies I haven’t touched before, such as SHA-256 encryption.
5. Gain connections in the Computer Science industry.
